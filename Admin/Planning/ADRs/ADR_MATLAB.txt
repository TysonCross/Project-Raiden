ADR: MATLAB IDE

CONTEXT:
MATLAB offers a unified, powerful scripting environment with a dedicated Deep Learning Toolbox, with support for the creation and analysis of existing networks
DECISION:
We will use MATLAB instead of TensorFlow due to the ease of use, familiarity and access to graphical network design tools and functions.
STATUS: 
Accepted.

CONSEQUENCES:
Pros:
	- Performant
	- Ease of use
	- Existing networks simple to use and modify
Cons:
	- Large install size
	- Limits the availible networks (although can import from Caffe, Innx, etc.)
	- Not industry norm (PyTorch/Tensorflow widely adopted in ML applications)
