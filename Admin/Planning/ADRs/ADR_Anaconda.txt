ADR: Python Environment managment

CONTEXT:
Using a python environment requires the management of the environement that the
program is run in as well as to replicate this enviroment accross multiple
systems easily.
OPTIONS:
Miniconda- Uses the conda package manager, is minimal and easy to install, light
weight. Creates a virtual environment
Anaconda- Convient,uses the conda package manager with many packages pre-installed requiring less time meeting dependancies, creates a virtual enviroment. 
virutalenv- Requires sudo access, and requires the use of the pip package manager.
DECISION:
We will use anaconda due to the ease of use and preinstalled packages
STATUS: 
Accepted, with an option to move to miniconda.

CONSEQUENCES:
Pros:
	- Easy install
	- Extensive documentation
	- Fewer dependency problems 
	- Vitual environment
	- Can easily change to miniconda for remote excecution
Cons:
	- Large install size(~3.5G) on each installation
